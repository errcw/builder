To Do
-----
- Add world serialization
- Add world deserialization (from tag?)
- Add a tutorial
- Tweak the world parameters (friction? gravity?)
- Remove boxes that have fallen outside the view
- Clean up the art
  * Better share button?
  * Better G+ icons?
  * Try G+ colours?
- Any way to avoid uploading a unique world every share?

Notes
-----
- serialize bodies (position, rotation, shape parameters)
  * JSON? will JSON.stringify(list) be sufficient?
  * custom? parse to simple data, then JSONify
- deserialize bodies and add them to the world
  * will jitter be a problem for stacked bodies? is there some way to cope?
- can the data be passed via url params alone?
- alternative is to build a store on app engine; also allows storing previews
  * worlds/id.json
  * worlds/id.png
  * prevents client-only/static serving
- colours?
- tutorial
  * click and drag to move
  * hit toggle to enter creation mode
  * click and drag to create (add bad creation prevention)
  * hit toggle to go back to selection mode
